TESTING CONCEPT ***

Since UI errors are visible very quick while debugging, our tests focus on the components manipulating data (i.e. the provider classes).

The tests for database methods should at least cover the CRUD scenarios (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Further implemented methods should also be testet for expected results. A typical test run for a class C should look like this:

1. Create an entity
2. Retrieve the entity from the database
3. If given: Test other methods that retrieve data (i.e. filtered return methods)
4. Update the entity and check if all modifications are persisted
5. If given: Test other methods that modify data (i.e. the change password method)
6. Delete the entity
7. If given: Test other methods (i.e. the delete all methods).
